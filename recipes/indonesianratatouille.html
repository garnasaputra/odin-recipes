        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Coat the bottom of a skillet with oil and place it over medium heat. 
                    Combine shallots, peppers, tomato, and garlic in the skillet and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. 
                    Add tempeh, bell pepper, and okra; stir quickly to combine. 
                    Add broth and eggplant; bring to a low boil and cook for about 5 minutes. 
                    Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until all vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                    Stir in coconut milk and brown sugar. Season with salt and pepper.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cook's Notes:</h4>
        <p>
            Omit chili peppers for a non-spicy dish.
            Eggplant can be replaced with tamarillo, which would be added with the tempeh.
